## Clean Water Project Implementation Part II

### 1. Project Scope

In this part of the project we will be implementing a prototype of the water station. This step of the project is to provide a real time visualization of all the elements of the water station in action. We use this prototype to help us present the project to potential collaborators and anyone who might want to join us in this adventure.

### 2. Components

Each water station will need to have at the minimum two water pumps, a water tower, and a control mechanism. 
We will be using electronic components in order to model a water station and demonstrate how the project will actually work when implemented. We will use the following components to achieve our goal:
1- Two electric motors
2- One GSM unit compatible with Microprocessors
3- One Microprocessor
4- Two ultrasonic water sensors
5- Two water meters
6- One breadboard
7- Accessories

### 3. Software

We will use C# or Python to write a code which will control the different components. The program will receive input from the different sensors and process the data in order to produce automatic functionality at the water station. Windows IoT will be used to implement the code in C sharp language and Linux will be the platform on which Python will used.

### 4. Conclusion

The goal of the project is to implement a fully functioning water station's prototype, which will be run automatically and controlled remotely via SMS. This project will also highlight the expansion possibilities of a more advanced automation using the cloud and the TV-White Space technology.
